### Just a Game
I've always like computers and anything technology related since I was a kid. My parents both have careers in technology, and they introduced me to technology at a young age. I would often sneak to play video games on my dad's tablet and PC whenever I got the chance. I found it interesting how one object could be so complex and contain a vast amount of information and activities. My main interest in computers came from video games. One of the first video games I ever played was Minecraft. At first, I had no idea how to use the controls. I was like 7 and I had never used WASD controls before, so I spent a while just staring at the game not knowing how to move. Eventually, I figured out how to move, and from there I discovered how fun it was to create whatever I wanted. In elementary school, we would have computer classes every week, where we learned to type, code, and draw. This was probably my favorite class as we used block code to create colorful drawings, funny characters, and interesting landscapes. I also really enjoyed learning how to type. Ever since then, I have been interested in Computer Science and obsessed with video games.

### Importance of Software Development
Software Development is an essential part of technology and is used in many aspects of daily life. I think this class will be very interesting to me, as I like to create things from scratch using my creativity and imagination. I really like video games, but I'm sure it is a very meticulous and tedious process to create, so I've never really tried to make one. I've always been more interested in the gameplay and design of the game rather than the actual programming. I hope in this class I can learn more about software development so I can try create something from my scratch with my imagination and coding skills. \

### Uncertain Future
In this class, I want to figure out what specific field of Computer Science interests me the most. Ever since I was in middle school, I wanted to have a career in Computer Science. However, I've never really decided on what field I want to specialize in. I thought about Data Science and Software Development but I'm still not sure. I hope after I finish this class I will know which one I want to do. I know I want to do something related to computers, but in today's ever-evolving world, there are so many different categories of technology to learn about.
