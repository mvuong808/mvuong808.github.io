### Thoughts on TypeScript
So far, TypeScript has been a useful language for me. I didn't know much about JavaScript or TypeScript before, so this was pretty new to me. The syntax was somewhat similar to language likes Java or C, but there were a lot of different things that I had to adjust to as well. In other languages, there is less structure when it comes to keep types of variables consistent, so I found TypeScript to be quite helpful in accomplishing that. From a software engineering perspective, I think that TypeScript is a great language to use, as it improves readabilty, functionality, and the ability to spot errors in code. I could definitely see myself using this language in the future if I decide to learn more about software development.


### Athletic Software Engineering (WODs)
This type of learning is kind of my style, as I like to go fast when I code, but at the same time it needs to be correct. It is definitely more stressful than regular coding, as it has a timed component, but it definitely helps me develop a sense of pacing and what I need to lay out before I code so I don't waste time. So far, I haven't had to use AI for anything in this class, but I could see how AI may be useful in the WODs if you are stuck or need to write something repetitive. I hope to be able to be much more efficient and accurate when coding so I can achieve faster times on the WODs. I also found it interesting how important it is to have test cases in your code during WODs, as well as knowing when to check with the professor, as there are many other students trying to get their code checked at the same time.

### Challenges
TypeScript can be a bit challenging for me as the type system requires a lot of specifications and requirements. I think the hardest part about TypeScript will be mastering the use of the type system and learning more about how to use them properly. When doing the WODs, I think I will run into problems with the type system, but over time I hope to be able to identify and resolve this problems quickly. Also, since I am not used to TypeScript and JavaScript, sometimes it takes me a while to think of the general layout of my code before attempting a WOD, so I am a bit slow in that regard. I think this won't be as mcuh of a problem as the semester progresses, as I will be able to have a lot more practice and experience.
I didn't use any AI assistance to write this essay.
