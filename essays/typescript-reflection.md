So far, TypeScript has been a useful language for me. I didn't know much about JavaScript or TypeScript before, so this was pretty new to me. The syntax was somewhat similar to language likes Java or C, but there were a lot of different things that I had to adjust to as well. In other languages, there is less structure when it comes to keep types of variables consistent, so I found TypeScript to be quite helpful in accomplishing that. From a software engineering perspective, I think that TypeScript is a great language to use, as it improves readabilty, functionality, and the ability to spot errors in code./

## Athletic Software Engineering (WODs)/
This type of learning is kind of my style, as I like to go fast when I code, but at the same time it needs to be correct. It is definitely more stressful than regular coding, as it has a timed component, but it definitely helps me develop a sense of pacing and what I need to lay out before I code so I don't waste time. So far, I haven't had to use AI for anything in this class, but I could see how AI may be useful in the WODs if you are stuck or need to write something repetitive. I hope to be able to be much more efficient and accurate when coding so I can achieve faster times on the WODs.
